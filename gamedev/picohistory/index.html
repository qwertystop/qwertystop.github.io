       A PICO-8 reimagining
      </h2>
      <p>
      The idea here was to take a few old games and rebuild them, with modifications,
      for the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8 fantasy console</a>.
      I ended up with four; here they are for your entertainment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="pong.html">Pong</a></li>
       <li><a href="spacewar.html">Spacewar!</a></li>
       <li><a href="pacman.html">Pac-Man</a></li>
       <li><a href="wumpus.html">Hunt the Wumpus</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This was an interesting project; I never really ran into the PICO-8's limitations,
      but working in Lua, and building most of several games from the ground up, was educational.
      The results are more entertaining than I expected of such old things, too.
      </p>
      <p>
      I did use a chunk of engine code from
      <a href="https://eev.ee/release/2016/05/25/under-construction-our-pico-8-game/">Under Construction (by Glip and Eevee)</a>
      in Pong, but the later ones stripped out most of it in favor of something I understood better
      by way of building it myself. I think that was the right choice for rapid development,
      but none of the stuff I built really lends itself to a re-usable engine, so who knows.
