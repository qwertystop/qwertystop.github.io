       Classic games, remade on the console that never was

      <p>
      The idea here was to take a few old games and rebuild them, with modifications,
      for the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8 fantasy console</a>.
      I ended up with four; here they are for your entertainment.

      </ul>

      This was an interesting project; I didn't run into the PICO-8's limitations as much as I expected.
      On the other hand, working in Lua, and building most of several games from the ground up, was quite educational.
      The results are more entertaining than I expected of such old things, too.

      I did use a chunk of engine code from
      <a href="https://eev.ee/release/2016/05/25/under-construction-our-pico-8-game/">Under Construction (by Glip and Eevee)</a>
      in Pong, but the later ones stripped out most of it in favor of something I understood better
      by way of building it myself. I think that was the right choice for rapid development,
      but none of the stuff I built really lends itself to a re-usable engine, so who knows.
