## Controls:
- **Arrow keys**: Move *(one room at a time)*.
- **Z, C, or N**: Prepare to shoot (then give up to 5 directions to direct the arrow).
- **X, V, or M**: Listen to the sounds in your current room.

## Instructions:

You are in a maze of twenty caves. You need to find, and shoot, the Wumpus.
If you walk into a room with a bat in it, it will carry you to another room.
If you walk into a room with a pit or the Wumpus in it, you will die and the game resets.

Sound is a part of this game: Bats *(squeaking)* and
bottomless pits *(rushing wind)* can be heard from one room away,
but the Wumpus's stomping can be heard from up to two rooms away.

If you need help navigating, a map of doors and moss colors is below.
It does not include the pits, bats, wumpus, or your start location, as these change every round.

If you miss with an arrow, the Wumpus will move by one room.
Everything else stays put until you win or die.

Your arrows are magic "crooked arrows" which can turn corners.
When you shoot, give up to five directions; the arrow will follow the path you give if there are doors where you tell it to go.
