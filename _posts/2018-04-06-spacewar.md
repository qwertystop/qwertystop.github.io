## Controls and Instructions:
Left and right to rotate, up to thrust, down to teleport. **Arrow keys** control the Needle; **ESDF** control the Wedge. Needle shoots with **N**, Wedge with **Tab or Left Shift**.
You each have five shots and about four seconds of thrust. That will be plenty.
## Changes from the original:
- Teleportation is instant and has no chance of self-destruction.
- The playfield is smaller, and the star is larger, relative to the ships
- Generally higher mobility (thrust is stronger than gravity unless extremely nearby the star).
- The star takes up a larger portion of the screen.
- Projectiles are affected by gravity.
- There is no cooldown between firing shots.
- Projectiles do not have a limited range.
- Ammunition limit is much smaller.
- Fuel limit is probably different, but I havenâ€™t been able to last long enough to run out in either version.
